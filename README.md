## Polyglot Plugins

This repository contains examples of Cloudify plugins written in languages other than Python.  The general approach mirrors the functionality of the script plugin, which utilizes a Cloudify component, the context proxy.  The proxy acts as a bridge between Python and non-Python languages.  The language adapters in the examples include code that talks to the proxy from the native plugin language.  The same approach can be used by any language in principle.  These examples represent a framework for creating your own polyglot plugins, *not* a particular implementation.
